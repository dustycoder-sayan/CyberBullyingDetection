# CyberBullyingDetection

This project is made towards the Fantom Code' 22 Hackathon held on 10th June - 11th June 2022. 

We aim at developing a software that can be integrated with social media and other messaging platforms. This software runs an ML model in the backend detecting whether the person on the other side (with whom the user is chatting with) is a threat to the user in terms of cyber bullying.
